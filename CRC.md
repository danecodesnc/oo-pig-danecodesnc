CRC Map for Dice Game

Game: The game needs to start and end. The players are trying to reach 100 points. The first player that reaches 100 points is the winner. They roll a die over and over until they roll a 1 (a "pig") or they choose to hold. If they hold, they add the sum of their rolls to their score. If they roll a 1, they get no points. After a 1 is rolled or the player holds, the other player takes their turn.

Note: I am only using one dice in this project. 

Dice: The dice contain 6 rows, you can have up to 6 different options. If you roll a 1, you loose your turn.

Dealer: The computer in the game and supplies the dice. The computer player will always hold until they roll a total of 20 points.


Player: Two players. One human player, and a computer. The first player is chosen randomly. (For example, you could flip a coin or both roll a die and pick the higher roll.)
